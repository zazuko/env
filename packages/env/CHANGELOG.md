## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- b06db23: Added a `@zazuko/env/web.js` module which does not include dependencies on Node.js modules that are not available in the browser. This is useful for web applications that use the `@zazuko/env` and avoid bundling issues.

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 1ddac0f: Fixes a weird build problem that generated types referenced `TermSetFactory` from rdf-ext, although it was not used at all. Had to remove `rdf-ext` from dev dependencies of `@zazuko/env` to fix it.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- a9b5fb3: Missing peer dependencies on types

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- 2aab3d0: Change the method of creating derived environments:

  1. The additional factories have been removed from the `create` function.
  2. To create a derived environment, use the constructor overload which takes a parent environment as the second argument in addition to the array of additional factories.

  For example,

  ```js
  import env from "@zazuko/env";
  import Environment from "@zazuko/env/Environment.js";
  import MyFactory from "./my-factory.js";

  const myEnv = new Environment([MyFactory], { parent: env });
  ```
