# Batteries-included [RDF/JS Environment](https://github.com/rdfjs-base/environment) bundle

‼️Not intended for production use. Use `@zazuko/env` instead ‼️

This package was created to use directly in RunKit which still only supports commonjs packages.

```js
const env = require('@zazuko/env-bundle')
```
